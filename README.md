# Golang101

Simple go projects to help me learn Go language.

## Projects
* A simple rock, paper, scissor commandline game - uses decision making and loops
* A simple commandline calculator - made up of two modules. One module is the addition library which is intended to be imported by other libraries or applications and the second one is a caller application which will make use of the first
* A simple movie app - uses go struct, struct receiver methods(value and pointer) to implement a movie reviews app by liking a movie
* A simple commandline CRUD books app - uses go struct, error handling, loops, mongodb, Bson to manipulate a collection of books in a Mongo document database.

## Common Features That cut across most of the projects

* Variables
* Data types
* Operators
* Decision making
* Loops
* Data Validation
* Modularization
* Bson
* Error handling
* Mongo-driver
